This website features three powerful ciphers - Caesar Shift, Polybius Square, and Substitution - each with the option to encode and decode your messages.

### Caesar Shift
The Caesar Shift cipher, one of the oldest and most well-known ciphers in history, allows you to shift each letter in your message by a specified number of positions in the alphabet. This makes your message virtually unreadable without the key.

### Polybius Square
The Polybius Square cipher, on the other hand, uses a grid of letters and numbers to encode your message. This cipher is more complex than the Caesar Shift, but also more secure.

### Substitution Cipher
The Substitution cipher allows you to replace each letter in your message with a different letter or symbol. The user provides a unique alphabet and each letter is replaced with the corresponding letter from the key. This cipher can be extremely difficult to crack, especially if you use a random key.
